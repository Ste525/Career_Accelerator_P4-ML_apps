# Predicting-Telecom-Churn-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Retain-Customers

*Telecom Churn Prediction is a machine learning project that aims to predict customer churn in the telecom industry. Churn prediction is important for telecom companies because it helps them to retain their customers and reduce customer acquisition costs. The figure below depicts the description of the dataset importation and screenshot of same.*

## Project Description
You will have a minimal interface demo with Gradio & Streamlit, this will just serve you to make sure that everything works correctly. Then, you will have to make your own interfaces, those allowing you to interact with a Machine Learning model, that is to say:

Pass values through the interface;
Recover these values in backend;
Apply the necessary processing;
Submit the previously processed values to the ML model to make the predictions;
Process the predictions obtained and display them on the interface.
